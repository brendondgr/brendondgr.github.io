If this is the first time you have opened and you haven't run any of the ""data_retrieval.py"" files, the red ""No Processed Data Found!"" section will appear at the bottom."
../images/fellowship/image2.png,2. The Login and Scrape Buttons,"To get started with finding Fellowships, you'll need to provide your login information in the ""Login"" drop-down for all available websites. Currently, only Profellow is available. ""Scrape"" should be clicked after your provide the login credentials, otherwise no scraping can be accomplished."
../images/fellowship/image3.png,3. Scraping Interface,"The scraping interface has many different options available, tuned for searching various databases. ""Browser Type"" will load specific Selenium Webdrivers for scraping to occur. You must have the respective Browser downloaded. API Keys must also be provided for certain features to appear, specifically for finding more information online for the particular Fellowship. My recommendation is to use Perplexity in this case. There is also various drop-down menus available, but you must open to see all available options."
../images/fellowship/image4.png,4. Refreshing Page,"Once you click the ""Begin Searching"" button at the bottom of the Scraping Window, you'll be brought to the main screen once more. Here, you'll have to watch your terminal until you see ""Data refinement process finished"". Once you do, press the refresh button in the middle of the screen, or restart the app."
